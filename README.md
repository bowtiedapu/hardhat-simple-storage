# Hardhat Simple Storage

## Steps to Recreate Your Own Hardhat Simple Storage App

4. `yarn add --dev prettier prettier-plugin-solidity`
5. `yarn add --dev dotenv`

## How to Build, Run, and Deploy

2. `yarn hardhat test`
3. `yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js` or `yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat`

## Notes

- Adding `--dev` when we do `yarn add` is for development purposes. Regular dependencies are required to run your project, dev dependencies are required to develop/build your project.
- yarn == npm == npx
- `@` packages are scoped packages which allow NPM packages to be namespaced. Every user and organization on NPM has their own scope. This means that they are the only user(s) and organizations who can add packages to it. This helps with identifying which packages are "official". The package name only has to be unique to the scope it is published in, not the entire registry i.e. `@yarn/http` as opposed to plain old `http`
- `hardhat-ethers` is just another dependency
- chainlist dot org has all the chain ID details needed when developing
